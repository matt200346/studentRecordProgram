# studentRecordProgram

This program is a simple program that displays a menu and asks the user to select from three options:  
Add record  
find record by ID  
and quit  
<br>
there is a studentrecord object and a custom error that may be thrown.  
I am using this as a program to mess around with stuff this is just the start.
